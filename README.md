# soccer_pong
Welcome to soccer pong! A game thats mixed between soccer and tennis, where you can play with friends seeing who can win the game.

The game logic was to recreate the oringal game pong from scratch by using canvas, DOM manipulation, and loops to allow the game to function.

Using CSS to style certain elements to style the game

My MVP goals were to make a full functing game that allows the user to player against someone else, and have a chance to win. Also wanted to make daily commits if possible. 

Future updates
allow the game to speed up if the user cant score within a certain time frame

Adding rounds to the game and reseting the game 

Tunring it into a website that stores other games in it allowing the user to choose between different games.
